# Beacon v2.x

<!-- [![Testsuite](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon-2.x/workflows/Testsuite/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EGA-archive/beacon-2.x/actions) -->

This repository is an implementation of the [Beacon v2.0 Model](https://github.com/ga4gh-beacon/beacon-v2-Models) and contains:

* The (Python 3.9+) [source code for beacon](beacon),
* A MongoDB database with sample data to demo the capabilities of the Beacon API.
* AAI and LS-AAI integrated. For LS-AAI, gdi ls aai mock repository is required to be up and running in another docker compose service, and then you will need to create this external network:
```bash
docker network create my-app-network
```

> [Local deployment instructions](deploy/README.md)

### Managing AAI-LSAAI permissions

To give the right permissions for AAI you will need to set the permissions of the users inside permissions folder, within the [permissions.yml](permissions/permissions.yml) file. 
Please, bear in mind that the name of the user has to be the same that you used when creating the user in LS or in IDP, whatever the AAI method you are working with.
Furthermore, if you are using LS-AAI method, you will need to get the authorization code following LS-AAI authorization flow method with a browser (for example http://localhost:8080/oidc/auth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=app-123) and then pass this code via a POST request to get the authorization token. For example:
```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:8080/oidc/token' \--header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \--data-urlencode 'grant_type=authorization_code' \--data-urlencode 'code=pasteyourcodefrombrowserhere' \--data-urlencode 'client_id=app-123' \--data-urlencode 'client_secret=secret_value' \--data-urlencode 'scope=openid' \
--data-urlencode 'requested_token_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:refresh_token'
```
When you have your authorization token, pass it in a header in your POST request to get your answers.
