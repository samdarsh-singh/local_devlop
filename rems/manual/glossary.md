## General terms

**Catalogue**
Catalogue lists all the catalogue items that users can apply for access rights.

**Catalogue item**
Catalogue items are resources the applicant can apply for access to.

A catalogue item consists of a resource, a license, a workflow and the application form. For example, a biobank sample collection.

**Entitlement**
Entitlement means the access right. Entitlement is granted when the applicant has accepted the license terms and their application is approved

**Resource**
Resource means the material or the data that needs have controlled access, for example a sensitive scientific dataset. Resource is the core part of a catalogue item.

**Workflow**
A workflow determines how the application’s approval process proceeds and who is in charge of the application. Workflow is a part of a catalogue item.

**Licence**
A license defines the terms and conditions for the use of the data. In REMS, a license can be an external link, an attached file or simply text added to the application form.

Licenses are connected to resources.

## Roles

**Applicant**
An applicant is a user who applies for an access right to a data resource by filling in the application form.

**Member**
A member is a user who has been added to an application by an applicant or a handler. Members are often part of the applicant’s research group.

Members will be granted access rights once the application is approved and they have accepted the licenses.

**Handler**
A handler is a user who processes the access rights applications. Generally, handlers decide whether the application should be approved or rejected. They can also request reviews and decisions from other users.

Resource owners assign handlers.

**Decider**
Decider is a user who can approve or reject applications suggested by handlers. Decider role is used when a handler should not be able to approve or reject applications, for example in governmental office use.

**Owner**  
An owner is a user who lists and manages their data resources in REMS. Owners can create organisations and assign organisation owners. Owners also assign handlers and reviewers to process the applications.

Owner role is always assigned by the REMS admins.

**Reporter**
Reporter is a user who can only view all applications. Can be used for e.g. a supervisor who should only monitor the application process.

**Reviewer**
Reviewer is a user who can review and comment on applications but cannot approve or reject them. Handlers invite reviewers to evaluate applications.

**Organisation owner**
Organisation owner is a user who can manage their own organisation’s resources.
